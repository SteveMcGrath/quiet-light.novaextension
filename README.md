# Quiet Light

Light, peaceful coding for [Nova](https://panic.com/nova/) from Panic; based on previous incarnations for [Espresso](https://github.com/onecrayon/E3-Theme-Generator) and [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=onecrayon.theme-quietlight-vsc).

Please let me know if you run into any syntax coloring weirdness or if you have any requests through the [project issues](https://github.com/onecrayon/quiet-light.novaextension/issues)!
